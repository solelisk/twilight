<h2> Chapter One </h2>
<br>

<p>"That's <b>Edward</b> and Emmett Cullen, and Rosalie and Jasper Hale. The one who left was
Alice Cullen; they all live together with Dr. Cullen and his wife." She said this under her breath. I glanced sideways at the beautiful boy, who was looking at his tray now, picking a bagel to pieces with long, pale fingers. His mouth was moving very quickly, his perfect lips barely opening. The other three still looked away, and yet I felt he was speaking quietly to them.</p>

<p> Strange, unpopular names, I thought. The kinds of names grandparents had. But maybe
that was in vogue here - small town names? I finally remembered that my neighbor was called Jessica, a perfectly common name. There were two girls named Jessica in my History class back home. They are . .. very nice-looking." I struggled with the conspicuous understatement.“Yes!” Jessica agreed with another giggle. "They're all <i>together</i> though - Emmett and Rosalie, and Jasper and Alice, I mean. And they <i>live</i> together" Her voice held all the shock and condemnation of the small town, I thought critically. But, if I was being honest, I had to admit that even in Phoenix, it would cause gossip.</p>

<p id= "special"> "Which ones are the Cullens?" I asked. "They don't look related..."</p>

<p>"Oh they're not. Dr. Cullen is really young, in his twenties or early thirties. They're all adopted. The Hales are brother and sister, twins - the blondes - theyre all foster children."</p>

<p> "They look a little old for foster children."</p>

<p> "They are now, Jasper and Rosalie are both eighteen, but they've been with Mrs. Cullen since they were eight. She's their aunt or something like that."</p>
